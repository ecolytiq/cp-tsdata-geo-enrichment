# cp-tsdata-geo-enrichment

Welcome to the example application repository! 
----
This repo is used as a real life example project throughout Mirko's tutorial sessions.
Instead of working with isolated example projects, one per lecture, I decided to build
several tutorials around the evolving real world project.

Welcome to the experiment!

## Scope of the Application
The application provides a geo enrichment service for data in motion. For example, time series data 
which is obtained in the field by sensors (fixed location) or vehicles (mobile source) will be streamed
into the system. Reference data is merged into the flow and context aware qualification of the data points
is applied. Results are aggregated and exported into a visual layer. In addition, the data is kept in the system 
for further processing in other stages.

The slide deck (WIP) for my next meetup-talk is available here:
